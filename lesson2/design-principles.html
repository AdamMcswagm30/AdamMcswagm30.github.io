                <h3>Stone's Toyota</h3>
                <img class='example_imgs' src='../photos/Fitts_law.png' alt="Stone's Toyota Picture">
                <p>This image from Stone's Toyota is a good example of Fitt's Law. As you can see here, the button options on this web page are very large and stand out so that they are easier for the user to click on</p>

                <h2 class='title'>Rule of Thirds</h1>
                <h3>Delta Airlines</h3>
                <img class='example_imgs' src='../photos/Rule_of_thirds.png' alt='Delta Airlines Photo'>
                <p>If you go to Delta Airlines' website, nearly every picture they have on there shows a perfect example of the rule of thirds. As you can see here in these two pictures from their website, both of them are off-centered to look more interesting to the user. </p>

                <h2 class='title'>Law of Closure</h1>
                <h3>Dr. Pepper</h3>
                <img class='example_imgs' src='../photos/Law_of_closure.png' alt='Dr. Pepper logo on a can'>
                <p>As we can see from the Dr. Pepper logo, the oval that surrounds the brand name does not fully connect. This is a proper usage of the law of closure, because when people see things that are not complete it catches their eye easier and seems more interesting to them.</p>
